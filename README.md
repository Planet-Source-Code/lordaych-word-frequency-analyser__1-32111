## Word Frequency Analyser


</div>

### Description

Paste the contents of a plaintext document into the main multiline text box, click "Parse," and this program creates an array for each unique word and the frequency at which the word occurs in the string. I made this to check my own writing for over-used words; if you're a writer you may notice how you tend to use the same words over and over again; in conjunction with a thesaurus this could be a powerful tool to liven up your use of vocabulary.
 
### More Info
 
Copy some text to the clipboard and paste it into the main window.

None...this code uses basic string manipulation and bubble sorting algorithms. Instead of using the split() function I have my own algorithm for parsing text into individual words and then adding those words to the arrays.

The program generates a visual report showing unique words and the frequency at which they occur. This list can be sorted by word length (best) or frequency.
